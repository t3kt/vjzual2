# vjzual2
vjzual2 is a modular video processing and VJ performance system built in [TouchDesigner](http://derivative.ca/).

## Goals
* Modular - functionality should be encapsulated in modules which are (relatively) self-contained.
* Configurable - modifying settings such as rendering resolution should be easy, as should managing module parameters (preset saving/loading, etc).
* Extensible - adding new functionality should be (relatively) straightforward (e.g. it should be easier to create a new effect module that has all the control/ui/mapping/etc features that other modules have than it would be to write an FFGL plugin to add an effect to [Resolume](http://resolume.com/))
* Controllable - control in a performance setting should be (relatively) straightforward
* Awesome - yep.
